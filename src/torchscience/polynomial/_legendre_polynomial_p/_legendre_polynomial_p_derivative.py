def legendre_polynomial_p_derivative(
    a: LegendrePolynomialP,
    order: int = 1,
) -> LegendrePolynomialP:
    """Compute derivative of Legendre series.

    Uses the recurrence relation:
        P'_n = (2n-1)*P_{n-1} + P'_{n-2}

    which leads to the algorithm (matching numpy's legder):
        der[j-1] = (2j-1)*c[j], c[j-2] += c[j]  for j = n, n-1, ..., 3
        der[1] = 3*c[2]
        der[0] = c[1]

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : LegendrePolynomialP
        Series to differentiate.
    order : int, optional
        Order of derivative. Default is 1.

    Returns
    -------
    LegendrePolynomialP
        Derivative series.

    Notes
    -----
    The degree decreases by 1 for each differentiation.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = legendre_polynomial_p(torch.tensor([0.0, 1.0]))  # P_1
    >>> da = legendre_polynomial_p_derivative(a)
    >>> da.coeffs  # d/dx P_1 = 1 = P_0
