    Parameters
    ----------
    a, b : HermitePolynomialHe
        Hermite series to compare.
    tol : float
        Absolute tolerance for coefficient comparison.

    Returns
    -------
    Tensor
        Boolean tensor, shape matches broadcast of batch dims.

    Notes
    -----
    Series of different lengths are compared by padding the shorter
    one with zeros.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = hermite_polynomial_he(torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]))
    >>> b = hermite_polynomial_he(torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]))
