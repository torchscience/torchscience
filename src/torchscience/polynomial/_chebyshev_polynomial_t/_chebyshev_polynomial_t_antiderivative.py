def chebyshev_polynomial_t_antiderivative(
    a: ChebyshevPolynomialT,
    order: int = 1,
    constant: float = 0.0,
) -> ChebyshevPolynomialT:
    """Compute antiderivative of Chebyshev series.

    Uses the formula:
        a_1 = c_0 - c_2/2
        a_k = (c_{k-1} - c_{k+1}) / (2k)  for k >= 2
        a_0 = constant - p(0)  (where p(0) is the antiderivative at x=0)

    The constant of integration is chosen such that the antiderivative
    evaluates to `constant` at x=0, matching NumPy's chebint behavior.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ChebyshevPolynomialT
        Series to integrate.
    order : int, optional
        Order of integration. Default is 1.
    constant : float, optional
        Integration constant. The antiderivative will evaluate to this
        value at x=0. Default is 0.0.

    Returns
    -------
    ChebyshevPolynomialT
        Antiderivative series.

    Notes
    -----
    The degree increases by 1 for each integration.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = chebyshev_polynomial_t(torch.tensor([1.0]))  # constant 1 = T_0
    >>> ia = chebyshev_polynomial_t_antiderivative(a)
    >>> ia.coeffs  # integral(1) = x = T_1
    tensor([0., 1.])
