    """Compute gradient of a scalar field.

    The gradient is the vector of partial derivatives along each spatial dimension.

    Parameters
    ----------
    field : Tensor
        Input scalar field with shape (..., *spatial_dims).
    dx : float or tuple of float, optional
        Grid spacing. Scalar applies to all dimensions, or provide per-dimension.
        Default is 1.0.
    dim : tuple of int, optional
        Spatial dimensions over which to compute gradient. Default uses all dimensions.
    accuracy : int, optional
        Accuracy order of the finite difference approximation. Default is 2.
    boundary : str, optional
        Boundary handling: "replicate", "zeros", "reflect", "circular", "valid".
        Default is "replicate".

    Returns
    -------
    Tensor
        Gradient field. If dim is None or specifies all dimensions, shape is
        (ndim, *field.shape). If dim specifies a subset, shape is
        (...batch_dims, len(dim), *spatial_dims) where the gradient components
        are inserted before the spatial dimensions.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> # 2D field
    >>> f = torch.randn(20, 30)
    >>> grad = gradient(f, dx=0.1)  # Shape: (2, 20, 30)

    >>> # Batched field with gradient over last 2 dimensions
    >>> f = torch.randn(10, 20, 30)
    >>> grad = gradient(f, dim=(-2, -1), dx=0.1)  # Shape: (10, 2, 20, 30)
