    order: int = 1,

) -> ChebyshevPolynomialU:
    """Compute antiderivative of Chebyshev U series.

    The antiderivative of U_n is computed using the relation:
        integral U_n dx = U_{n+1}/(2(n+1)) - U_{n-1}/(2(n-1)) for n >= 2
        integral U_0 dx = U_1/2
        integral U_1 dx = U_2/4

    The constant of integration is chosen such that the antiderivative
    evaluates to `constant` at x=0, matching NumPy's chebint behavior.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ChebyshevPolynomialU
        Series to integrate.
    order : int, optional
        Order of integration. Default is 1.
    constant : float, optional
        Integration constant. The antiderivative will evaluate to this
        value at x=0. Default is 0.0.

    Returns
    -------
    ChebyshevPolynomialU
        Antiderivative series.

    Notes
    -----
    The degree increases by 1 for each integration.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = chebyshev_polynomial_u(torch.tensor([1.0]))  # U_0 = 1
    >>> ia = chebyshev_polynomial_u_antiderivative(a)
    >>> ia.coeffs  # integral(1) = x = U_1/2, so need 2*U_1
