    Parameters
    ----------
    p : HermitePolynomialHe
        Input Hermite series.
    tol : float
        Tolerance for considering coefficient as zero.

    Returns
    -------
    HermitePolynomialHe
        Trimmed series with at least one coefficient.

    Notes
    -----
    For batched series, this trims based on the maximum absolute
    value across the batch for each coefficient position.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> c = hermite_polynomial_he(torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 0.0, 0.0]))
    >>> t = hermite_polynomial_he_trim(c)
    >>> t.coeffs
