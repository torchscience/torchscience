    Uses Horner's method for efficient evaluation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    p : Polynomial
        Outer polynomial.
    q : Polynomial
        Inner polynomial (substituted for x).

    Returns
    -------
    Polynomial

    Examples
    --------
    >>> p = polynomial(torch.tensor([0.0, 0.0, 1.0]))  # x^2
    >>> q = polynomial(torch.tensor([1.0, 1.0]))  # x + 1
