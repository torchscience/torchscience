def chebyshev_polynomial_v_derivative(
    a: ChebyshevPolynomialV,
    order: int = 1,
) -> ChebyshevPolynomialV:
    """Compute derivative of Chebyshev V series.

    Uses the recurrence relation for Chebyshev V derivatives.

    For Chebyshev V polynomials, the derivative satisfies:
        dV_n/dx = 2 * sum_{k=0}^{n-1} V_k(x)  where the sum is over k with same parity as n-1

    More specifically:
        dV_n/dx = 2 * (V_{n-1} + V_{n-3} + V_{n-5} + ...)

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ChebyshevPolynomialV
        Series to differentiate.
    order : int, optional
        Order of derivative. Default is 1.

    Returns
    -------
    ChebyshevPolynomialV
        Derivative series.

    Notes
    -----
    The degree decreases by 1 for each differentiation.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = chebyshev_polynomial_v(torch.tensor([0.0, 0.0, 1.0]))  # V_2
    >>> da = chebyshev_polynomial_v_derivative(a)
    >>> da.coeffs  # d/dx V_2
