    """Multiply Physicists' Hermite series by x.

    Uses the recurrence relation:
        x * H_k(x) = H_{k+1}(x)/2 + k * H_{k-1}(x)

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : HermitePolynomialH
        Series to multiply by x.

    Returns
    -------
    HermitePolynomialH
        Series representing x * a(x).

    Notes
    -----
    The degree increases by 1.

    The Hermite recurrence relation is:
        H_{n+1}(x) = 2x * H_n(x) - 2n * H_{n-1}(x)

    Solving for x * H_n(x):
        x * H_n(x) = (H_{n+1}(x) + 2n * H_{n-1}(x)) / 2
                   = H_{n+1}(x)/2 + n * H_{n-1}(x)

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = hermite_polynomial_h(torch.tensor([1.0]))  # H_0 = 1
    >>> b = hermite_polynomial_h_mulx(a)
    >>> b.coeffs  # x * H_0 = x = H_1/2
