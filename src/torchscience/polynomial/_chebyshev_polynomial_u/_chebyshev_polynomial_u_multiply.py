def chebyshev_polynomial_u_multiply(
    a: ChebyshevPolynomialU,
    b: ChebyshevPolynomialU,
) -> ChebyshevPolynomialU:
    """Multiply two Chebyshev U series.

    Uses the linearization formula for Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind:
        U_m(x) * U_n(x) = sum_{k=0}^{min(m,n)} U_{m+n-2k}(x)

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ChebyshevPolynomialU
        First series with coefficients a_0, a_1, ..., a_m.
    b : ChebyshevPolynomialU
        Second series with coefficients b_0, b_1, ..., b_n.

    Returns
    -------
    ChebyshevPolynomialU
        Product series with degree at most m + n.

    Notes
    -----
    The product of two Chebyshev U series of degrees m and n has degree m + n.
    The linearization formula ensures the product remains in Chebyshev U form.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = chebyshev_polynomial_u(torch.tensor([0.0, 1.0]))  # U_1
    >>> b = chebyshev_polynomial_u(torch.tensor([0.0, 1.0]))  # U_1
    >>> c = chebyshev_polynomial_u_multiply(a, b)
    >>> c.coeffs  # U_1 * U_1 = U_0 + U_2
