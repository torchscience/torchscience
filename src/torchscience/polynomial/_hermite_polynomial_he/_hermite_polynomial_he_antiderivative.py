    """Compute antiderivative of Probabilists' Hermite series.

    Uses the integration formula for Hermite_e polynomials:
        integral(He_n(x)) dx = He_{n+1}(x) / (n+1)

    The constant of integration is chosen such that the antiderivative
    evaluates to `constant` at x=0.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : HermitePolynomialHe
        Series to integrate.
    order : int, optional
        Order of integration. Default is 1.
    constant : float, optional
        Integration constant. The antiderivative will evaluate to this
        value at x=0. Default is 0.0.

    Returns
    -------
    HermitePolynomialHe
        Antiderivative series.

    Notes
    -----
    The degree increases by 1 for each integration.

    For Hermite_e polynomials:
        d/dx He_n(x) = n * He_{n-1}(x)

    Therefore:
        integral(He_n(x)) dx = He_{n+1}(x) / (n+1) + C

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = hermite_polynomial_he(torch.tensor([1.0]))  # He_0 = 1
    >>> ia = hermite_polynomial_he_antiderivative(a)
    >>> ia.coeffs  # integral(1) = x = He_1
    tensor([0., 1.])
