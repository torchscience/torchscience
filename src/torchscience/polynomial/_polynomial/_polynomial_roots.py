def polynomial_roots(p: Polynomial) -> Tensor:
    """Find polynomial roots via companion matrix eigenvalues.

    Parameters
    ----------
    p : Polynomial
        Polynomial with coefficients shape (..., N).
        Leading coefficient must be non-zero.

    Returns
    -------
    Tensor
        Complex roots, shape (..., N-1). Always complex dtype.

    Raises
    ------
    DegreeError
        If polynomial is constant (degree 0) or zero polynomial.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> p = polynomial(torch.tensor([2.0, -3.0, 1.0]))  # (x-1)(x-2)
    >>> polynomial_roots(p)
    tensor([1.+0.j, 2.+0.j])

    Notes
    -----
    Uses companion matrix method:
    - Construct companion matrix from normalized coefficients
    - Compute eigenvalues via torch.linalg.eigvals
    - Supports autograd through eigenvalue computation

    For high-degree polynomials (>20), use float64 for accuracy.
