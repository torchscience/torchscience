    """Compute derivative of Physicists' Hermite series.

    Uses the derivative formula for Hermite polynomials:
        d/dx H_n(x) = 2n * H_{n-1}(x)

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : HermitePolynomialH
        Series to differentiate.
    order : int, optional
        Order of derivative. Default is 1.

    Returns
    -------
    HermitePolynomialH
        Derivative series.

    Notes
    -----
    The degree decreases by 1 for each differentiation.

    For a Hermite series f(x) = sum_{k=0}^{n} c_k H_k(x),
    the derivative is:
        f'(x) = sum_{k=0}^{n} c_k * 2k * H_{k-1}(x)
              = sum_{j=0}^{n-1} (2*(j+1) * c_{j+1}) * H_j(x)

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = hermite_polynomial_h(torch.tensor([0.0, 1.0]))  # H_1 = 2x
    >>> da = hermite_polynomial_h_derivative(a)
    >>> da.coeffs  # d/dx H_1 = 2*1*H_0 = 2
