def hermite_polynomial_he_mulx(

) -> HermitePolynomialHe:
    """Multiply Probabilists' Hermite series by x.

    Uses the recurrence relation:
        x * He_k(x) = He_{k+1}(x) + k * He_{k-1}(x)

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : HermitePolynomialHe
        Series to multiply by x.

    Returns
    -------
    HermitePolynomialHe
        Series representing x * a(x).

    Notes
    -----
    The degree increases by 1.

    The Hermite_e recurrence relation is:
        He_{n+1}(x) = x * He_n(x) - n * He_{n-1}(x)

    Solving for x * He_n(x):
        x * He_n(x) = He_{n+1}(x) + n * He_{n-1}(x)

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = hermite_polynomial_he(torch.tensor([1.0]))  # He_0 = 1
    >>> b = hermite_polynomial_he_mulx(a)
    >>> b.coeffs  # x * He_0 = x = He_1
