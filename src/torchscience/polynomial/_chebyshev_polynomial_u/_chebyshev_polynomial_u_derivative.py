def chebyshev_polynomial_u_derivative(
    a: ChebyshevPolynomialU,
    order: int = 1,
) -> ChebyshevPolynomialU:
    """Compute derivative of Chebyshev U series.

    Uses the recurrence relation for Chebyshev U derivatives.
    The derivative of U_n is expressed in terms of U polynomials using
    the relationship:

        d/dx U_n(x) = (n+1) * sum_{k=0, step 2}^{n-1} 2*U_k(x) / (k+1 factor)

    A simpler formulation using backward recurrence is used.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ChebyshevPolynomialU
        Series to differentiate.
    order : int, optional
        Order of derivative. Default is 1.

    Returns
    -------
    ChebyshevPolynomialU
        Derivative series.

    Notes
    -----
    The degree decreases by 1 for each differentiation.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = chebyshev_polynomial_u(torch.tensor([0.0, 0.0, 1.0]))  # U_2
    >>> da = chebyshev_polynomial_u_derivative(a)
    >>> da.coeffs  # d/dx U_2 = 4*U_1
