    """Generate companion matrix for Chebyshev U series.

    The eigenvalues of the companion matrix are the roots of the series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : ChebyshevPolynomialU
        Chebyshev U series. Must be monic (leading coefficient 1) or
        will be normalized.

    Returns
    -------
    Tensor
        Companion matrix, shape (n, n) where n = degree.

    Notes
    -----
    The Chebyshev U companion matrix is a symmetric tridiagonal matrix.
    For U polynomials, the recurrence is U_{n+1} = 2x*U_n - U_{n-1},
    which leads to off-diagonal elements of 0.5.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> c = chebyshev_polynomial_u(torch.tensor([0.0, 0.0, 1.0]))  # U_2
    >>> A = chebyshev_polynomial_u_companion(c)
    >>> A.shape
