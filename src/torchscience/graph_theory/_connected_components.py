    r"""
    Find connected components of a graph.

    For undirected graphs, finds the maximal subsets of nodes where every
    pair of nodes is connected by a path.

    For directed graphs, supports two types of connectivity:

    - **Weak connectivity**: Ignores edge direction (treats graph as undirected)
    - **Strong connectivity**: Respects edge direction (u and v are in the same
      SCC if there exist paths u→v and v→u)

    Parameters
    ----------
    adjacency : Tensor
        Adjacency matrix of shape ``(N, N)``. Entry ``adjacency[i, j]`` is
        nonzero if there is an edge from node ``i`` to node ``j``.
        Can be dense or sparse COO tensor.
    directed : bool, default=True
        If True, treat the graph as directed. If False, treat as undirected
        (only weak connectivity is meaningful).
    connection : {"weak", "strong"}, default="weak"
        Type of connectivity to find:

        - ``"weak"``: Ignore edge direction (connected if path exists
          ignoring direction)
        - ``"strong"``: Respect edge direction (strongly connected components
          via Tarjan's algorithm). Only valid when ``directed=True``.

    Returns
    -------
    n_components : int
        Number of connected components.
    labels : Tensor
        Component label for each node, shape ``(N,)``. Labels are integers
        in ``[0, n_components)``. Nodes with the same label are in the same
        component.

    Examples
    --------
    Undirected graph with two components:

    >>> import torch
    >>> from torchscience.graph_theory import connected_components
    >>> # Two disconnected edges: 0-1 and 2-3
    >>> adj = torch.tensor([
    ...     [0., 1., 0., 0.],
    ...     [1., 0., 0., 0.],
    ...     [0., 0., 0., 1.],
    ...     [0., 0., 1., 0.],
    ... ])
    >>> n, labels = connected_components(adj, directed=False)
    >>> n
    2
    >>> labels
    tensor([0, 0, 1, 1])

    Directed graph - weak vs strong connectivity:

    >>> # Cycle: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0
    >>> adj = torch.tensor([
    ...     [0., 1., 0.],
    ...     [0., 0., 1.],
    ...     [1., 0., 0.],
    ... ])
    >>> n_weak, _ = connected_components(adj, connection="weak")
    >>> n_weak  # All nodes reachable ignoring direction
    1
    >>> n_strong, _ = connected_components(adj, connection="strong")
    >>> n_strong  # All nodes in same SCC (cycle)
    1

    >>> # Chain: 0 -> 1 -> 2 (no back edges)
    >>> adj = torch.tensor([
    ...     [0., 1., 0.],
    ...     [0., 0., 1.],
    ...     [0., 0., 0.],
    ... ])
    >>> n_weak, _ = connected_components(adj, connection="weak")
    >>> n_weak
    1
    >>> n_strong, labels = connected_components(adj, connection="strong")
    >>> n_strong  # Each node is its own SCC (no back paths)
    3

    Single node:

    >>> adj = torch.tensor([[0.]])
    >>> n, labels = connected_components(adj)
    >>> n, labels
    (1, tensor([0]))

    Notes
    -----
    - **Weak connectivity** uses Union-Find (disjoint set union) with path
      compression and union by rank. Time complexity: O(N² α(N)) where α
      is the inverse Ackermann function.
    - **Strong connectivity** uses Tarjan's algorithm. Time complexity:
      O(N + E) where E is the number of edges.
    - Self-loops do not affect connectivity.
    - Isolated nodes (no edges) each form their own component.
    - **No autograd support**: This function returns discrete labels and
      does not support gradient computation.
